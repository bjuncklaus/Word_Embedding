It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream
A past life love affair
Do you know me? At all
Do you know me? At all

In all my reverie
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
a flower in your hair
Do you know me? At all
Do you know me? At all

Do you know me? At all
Do you know me? At all
Do you know me? At all
Do you know me? At all
