Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number
How will I hold my head to keep from going under

Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're trying to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do
When the world keeps testing me, testing me

Oooooooooooo [4x]

What you gonna do about it? [3x]

Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
