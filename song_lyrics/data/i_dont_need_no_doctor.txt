I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me

I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery

I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

No, no, no, I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled, yeah
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill

Now the doctor say I need rest
For I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah

I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)
No, no, I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone

All I need is my baby, please!
Won't you please just come on home?
Come on home
