Do not waste this evening, baby I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm gonna do
Feel my chest when I look at you...

Baby you, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only, only, heart

So hard to be so far out living our separate lives
You phone was really broken - I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to tell you...

You, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only, only, heart

And you love like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold your love
(hold my love)
If you let me leave
I swear, I never will

Remember now you...
You've got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you've got my only
Only heart
