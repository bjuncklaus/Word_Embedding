We pick up in New York City
Tryin' to find the man I never got to be
When I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seems

The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water
Sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off
And repeat

It's just a phase
It's not forever
It's just a phase
But I still might have a ways to go

Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place

Walking home with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet
Great, now it's raining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water
Sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off
And repeat

It's just a phase
It's not forever
It's just a phase
But I still might have a ways

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water
Sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off
And repeat it, repeat it, repeat after me

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water
Sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water
Sleep
