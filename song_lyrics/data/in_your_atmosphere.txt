I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what its like to land and not race through your door
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore

I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key in your bedroom neighborhood
Me sleep-walkin in Hollywood

I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore

I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'd get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me I love you take a right
the ten and the two is the loneliest sight

I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you

I'm gonna steer clear, oh yeah
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
See you there

Think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay in the gray
Think I'm gonna stay (gonna stay)
And the street lights say nevermind, nevermind
And the canyon lines say nevermind
The sunset says we see this all the time, nevermind
Never you mind

Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, Wherever you are
I watch your life play out in pictures from afar

Wherever I go, Whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, Wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
