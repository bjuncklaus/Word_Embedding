Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Ain't supposed to make me feel alone

What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Now they're celebrating broken things
I don't want a world of broken things
You can tell that something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

La di da di da
La di da di da
La di da di da di da
La di da di da di da
Oh yeah

I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it
Just show me something I can be
Play a song that we can sing
Make us feel as we are free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
