Do you ever get the feelin'
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That we've been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like we've known ourselves that long

And I can't say I really blame you for being bored with the beginning
Always staring at the score to figure out who's barely winning
But don't you know
There is a reason strong, move slow

And I'm okay
If you're okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line

We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
And if you want to know the moment
I knew that I was still alone
I found I never learned your number
I only stored it in my phone
You'd think by now
Id know the shape of calling home

And I'm okay
If you're okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line

We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
Were both alone
We are tracing
We are tracing

Did you ever get the feeling
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That we've been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like we've knew ourselves that long
