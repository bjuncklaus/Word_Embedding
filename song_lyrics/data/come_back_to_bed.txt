Still is the life
Of your room
When you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
Tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed

What will this fix
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath
You are finished with

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come on come back to bed
Come back to bed...

[guitar solo]

You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation
From you baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed

Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love one more time around baby

Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head yeah
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Come on come back to bed
