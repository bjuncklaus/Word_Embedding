In these days, with the world getting colder,
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned.

Tonight we're gonna order in,
Drinking wine and watchin' CNN.
It's dark I know, but then again
It's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now we're people watching all the people watching us right back now
Standing by the missing signs at the CVS by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
'Cause she's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain
Covered, covered

And come December Lydia left
She mentioned something 'bout it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree and it's killing me
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers 'round her silhouette
I haven't gotten used to you
But it's the best thing I got
When I'm covered in rain

When I'm covered rain, rain, rain
Covered in rain, rain, rain

It's alright
If you don't want to, go on
It's alright
If you don't want to, be alone
Oh It's alright
If you don't want to, go home
I understand I understand I understand
When I'm covered in rain
