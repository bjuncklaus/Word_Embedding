Six numbers, one more to dial
Before I'm before you I tried to call
Been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back
And wait for you

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the Queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man, you know life as the man
Living life as the man on the side
