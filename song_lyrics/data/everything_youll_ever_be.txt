Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
But mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway

The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me

And you were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes

Saying "If my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now
'Cause everything you'll ever be
You already are to me"

Why, I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How, I don't know how
I don't know how but I just sit back and I see my way right through it

When the memories stand ten feet tall
Casting shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?

Days are long and words are cruel
But they won't get the best of you
'Cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me
Always been to me
